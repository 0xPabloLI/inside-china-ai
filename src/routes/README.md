# Routes

TanStack Start uses **file-based routing**. Every `.tsx` file in this directory
defines a route. Every route lives in this directory — Next.js / Remix style
`pages/` directories, nested `_app/` route groups and `app/layout.tsx` are not how
file-based routing works here. The only root layout
is `src/routes/__root.tsx`.

## Conventions

| File                     | URL                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.tsx`              | `/`                                                     |
| `about.tsx`              | `/about`                                                |
| `users/index.tsx`        | `/users`                                                |
| `users/$id.tsx`          | `/users/:id` (dynamic — bare `$`, no curly braces)      |
| `posts/{-$category}.tsx` | `/posts/:category?` (optional segment)                  |
| `files/$.tsx`            | `/files/*` (splat — read via `_splat` param, never `*`) |
| `_layout.tsx`            | layout route (renders children via `<Outlet />`)        |
| `__root.tsx`             | app shell — wraps every page; preserve `<Outlet />`     |
