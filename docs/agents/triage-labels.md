# Triage Labels

The triage skill uses five canonical roles. Label strings match role names.

## Category Labels

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `bug` | Something is broken |
| `enhancement` | New feature or improvement |

## State Labels

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `needs-triage` | Maintainer needs to evaluate |
| `needs-info` | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent` | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent |
| `ready-for-human` | Needs human implementation |
| `wontfix` | Will not be actioned |

## Triage Flow

```
New issue → needs-triage (needs evaluation)
          → needs-info (waiting for clarification)
          → ready-for-agent (agent-pickable)
          → wontfix (won't fix)

needs-triage + clarified → ready-for-agent / ready-for-human
needs-info + reporter replies → needs-triage
```

## Conventions

- Every triaged issue carries exactly one category label and one state label.
- `ready-for-agent` requires: (1) fully specified with acceptance criteria, (2) correct priority, (3) actionable by an agent without further human input.
- `wontfix` issues should be closed with an explanation comment.
