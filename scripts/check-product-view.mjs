/**
 * Product-view gate (#810).
 *
 * `docs/agents/implementation-workflow.md` §9 step 8 requires the "product-view
 * three sentences" (what user-visible problem / what the user sees now / what
 * did not change). §12 records that adding that rule did not work: deliveries
 * kept skipping it, and the recorded conclusion is that what was missing is
 * **blocking force, not wording**. This script is the blocking force — a bound
 * an agent can evaluate, checked on the pull-request body before CI goes green.
 *
 * The check is deliberately about presence and substance, not about truth: a
 * gate that cannot tell done from not-done just moves the skipping somewhere
 * less visible. Judging whether the three sentences are *true* stays with the
 * §9 product-verification gate, which a human reads.
 *
 * Contract (env in, exit code out — same shape as the other `scripts/` gates):
 *
 *   PR_BODY            full pull-request body
 *   PR_AUTHOR          pull_request.user.login
 *   PR_LABELS          comma-separated label names
 *   GITHUB_EVENT_NAME  defaults to "pull_request" (local runs have no event)
 *
 * Exit 0 = pass or exempt, exit 1 = fail with the reason and the three prompts.
